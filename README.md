- **[Twelve Data API](https://twelvedata.com/)**: For retrieving real-time stock market data (Free Plan).

## 🧑‍💻 Key Skills Involved

- **API Integration**: Connect to external data sources for real-time market information.
- **Data Streaming**: Use WebSocket or polling to receive live data updates.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive charts with Plotly or Dash.
- **Alert System**: Notify users via email or desktop notifications based on specific triggers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor selected cryptocurrencies and stock prices in real time.
- **Price Alerts**: Get notifications when price changes exceed predefined thresholds.
- **Trend Visualization**: Display trends with line charts and candlestick charts for better insights.
- **Historical Data Storage**: Save price data for future analysis and review.
